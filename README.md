## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design, deployment, and operation of a **production-grade 3-tier web application architecture on AWS**.

The solution serves a live product catalogue through a globally distributed infrastructure utilizing AWS networking, security, compute, database, and monitoring services. The architecture follows enterprise cloud design principles including:

* High Availability
* Scalability
* Security by Design
* Network Segmentation
* Secrets Management
* Load Balancing
* Observability
* Disaster Recovery Readiness

The application is deployed using Amazon EC2, Aurora MySQL, CloudFront, WAF, Application Load Balancers, Auto Scaling Groups, and AWS Secrets Manager.

## Architecture Flow

Browser (HTTPS)
 → CloudFront (WAF + TLS termination)
   → External ALB (public)
     → Web EC2 (Nginx:80 → Node.js:3000)
       → Internal ALB (private)
         → App EC2 (Flask:5000)
           → Aurora MySQL (private DB subnets)

### Demonstrated Functionality

The live deployment verifies:

✅ CloudFront global content delivery

✅ AWS WAF protection

✅ HTTPS/TLS encryption

✅ Public ALB request routing

✅ Node.js Web Tier

✅ Internal ALB communication

✅ Flask API Application Tier

✅ Aurora MySQL integration

✅ Secrets Manager credential retrieval

✅ Private subnet architecture

✅ Multi-tier communication

The screenshot above shows product data dynamically retrieved from Aurora MySQL and rendered through the full application stack.

# 🎯 Business Scenario

A retail organization requires a secure and scalable platform capable of serving product information to customers globally.

The solution must provide:

* Global low-latency access
* Secure application delivery
* High availability
* Database redundancy
* Operational visibility
* Elastic scaling
* Protection against common web attacks

This architecture was designed to satisfy those requirements while following AWS Well-Architected Framework principles.

# 🔒 Security Architecture

Security was implemented across every layer of the solution.

## Network Security

* Private subnets for Web and App tiers
* Aurora deployed in isolated database subnets
* Security Groups enforce tier-to-tier communication
* No direct database access from the internet

## Identity & Access Management

* IAM Roles attached to EC2 instances
* No hardcoded AWS credentials
* Principle of Least Privilege

## Secrets Management

Database credentials are securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager and retrieved dynamically by the Flask API.

```python
secret = client.get_secret_value(
    SecretId='prod/aurora/credentials'
)
```

## Edge Protection

* AWS WAF protects against common attacks
* HTTPS enforced through CloudFront
* TLS termination at the edge
